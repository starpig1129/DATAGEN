## System Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/starpig1129/DATAGEN.git
```
2. Create and activate a Conda virtual environment:
```bash
conda create -n datagen python=3.10
conda activate datagen
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Set up environment variables:
**Rename `.env Example` to `.env` and fill all the values**
```sh
# Your data storage path(required)
DATA_STORAGE_PATH =./data/

# Conda environment name(required)
CONDA_ENV = datagen

# ChromeDriver executable path(required)
CHROMEDRIVER_PATH =./chromedriver-linux64/chromedriver

# Firecrawl API key (optional)
# Note: If this key is missing, query capabilities may be reduced
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# OpenAI API key (optional)
OPENAI_API_KEY = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
# Anthropic API key (optional)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
# Google API key (optional)
GOOGLE_API_KEY = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# LangChain API key (optional)
# Used for monitoring the processing
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
## Usage

### Using Python Script

You can run the system  using main.py:

1. Place your data file (e.g., YourDataName.csv) in the data directory

2. Modify the user_input variable in the main() function of main.py:
```python
user_input = '''
datapath:YourDataName.csv
Use machine learning to perform data analysis and write complete graphical reports
'''
```

Ë‡. Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Main Components

- `hypothesis_agent`: Generates research hypotheses
- `process_agent`: Supervises the entire research process
- `visualization_agent`: Creates data visualizations
- `code_agent`: Writes data analysis code
- `searcher_agent`: Conducts literature and web searches
- `report_agent`: Writes research reports
- `quality_review_agent`: Performs quality reviews
- `note_agent`: Records the research process

## Workflow

The system uses LangGraph to create a state graph that manages the entire research process. The workflow includes the following steps:

1. Hypothesis generation
2. Human choice (continue or regenerate hypothesis)
3. Processing (including data analysis, visualization, search, and report writing)
4. Quality review
5. Revision as needed

### Agent Model Configuration

Users can customize each agent's language model provider and model configuration by editing the `config/agent_models.yaml` file. This allows for optimization of model selection and parameters based on different agent requirements.

Here's an example structure of `config/agent_models.yaml`:

```yaml
agents:
  hypothesis_agent:
    provider: openai
    model_config:
      model: gpt-5-nano
      temperature: 1.0
  note_agent:
    provider: google
    model_config:
      model: gemini-2.5-pro
      temperature: 1.0
  code_agent:
    provider: anthropic
    model_config:
      model: claude-haiku-4-5
      temperature: 1.0
```

- **provider**: Specifies the language model provider to use (e.g., openai, google, anthropic, ollama, groq)
- **model_config**: Contains model-specific configuration parameters
  - `model`: The specific model name to use
  - `temperature`: Controls the randomness of model output (range: 0.0-2.0)

## Notes

- Ensure you have sufficient API credits, as the system will make multiple API calls.
- The system may take some time to complete the entire research process, depending on the complexity of the task.
- **WARNING**: The agent system may modify the data being analyzed. It is highly recommended to backup your data before using this system.
